# Algorithm, 2021 Fall
This is an undergraduate-level course that focuses on fundamental results in the study of algorithm, including the unifying principles and underlying concepts of algorithm design and analysis.. This repo contains my solutions to the homework as well as the midterm and final projects. 

Additionally, althought I didn't attend the next course - Data structure - of this course, I self-learned the course content and finished all the homeworks. 

Professor: [Iris Hui-Ru Chiang](https://www.ee.ntu.edu.tw/profile1.php?id=1060726), department of electrical engineering

Final score: 78.8 / 100 (B+)

## Course contents
- Asymptotic analysis
- Insertion sort, merge sort
- Divide and conquer
- Sorting and order statistics
- Tree data structures
- Dynamic programming
- Greedy algorithms
- Breadth-first search (BFS), depth-first search (DFS)
- Minimum spanning tree (MST), disjoint sets
- Single-source shortest paths (SSSP)
- All-pairs shortest paths (APSP)
- Network flow

## Homework assignments

The homeworks of this class comprised of two parts - writing assignments and programming assignments. For writing assignments, I uploaded all my hand-written solutions in pictures. As for programming assignments, I coded in C++.

- PA0: Merge sort
- PA1: Insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort, heap sort
- PA2: Maximum planar subset (MPS)
- PA3: Cycle breaking

- HW1: Algorithm foundations
- HW2: Sorting algorithm, tree data strcture, MPS
- HW3: Dynammic programming, greedy algorithm
- HW4: BFS, DFFS, MST, SSSP, APSP, NP-Completeness, Amortized analysis

You could find more details in the directory of each homework.
